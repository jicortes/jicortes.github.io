Hi! I am an NSF MPS-Ascend Postdoctoral Fellow at UC Santa Cruz in the Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics. I received my Ph.D. from Columbia University. This site is currently under construction. 

Research Interests
======
My current interests include: "Spider" pulsars, X-ray binaries (in particular TeV binaries and X-ray bursters), acceleration of particles, non-thermal emission, magnetic reconnection, shock waves, computational methods, and data visualization.
